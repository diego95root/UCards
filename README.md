## Flashcards project

---

Written in python, this is sort of a web app which will hopefully help me learn new languages. It consists of a python CGI script which will render the flashcards as html and save all the data in a sqlite3 file. Each flashcard will consist of a word and its translation, along with an image grabbed from the internet. The image will be obtained through a Google API, so if you want to use it you will need to get the cx code and a key from google developers console.

Still in heavy development.
